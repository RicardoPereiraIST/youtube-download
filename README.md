# youtube-download

# **Description**
Using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl), downloads multiple files at once.
It's a command-line program to download multiple videos at once, by passing it a file with urls.
It requires the Python interpreter, and it should not be platform specific.

Only mp3 and mp4 formats are accepted, for now.
